Casuarius casuarius;Southern Cassowary;The cassowary is a mysterious loner and one of the most dangerous and aggressive flightless birds. Due to the displayed great timidity, it is more common to hear the bird's voice in the wild than to see it. The cassowary territories are located near water reservoirs. These birds show many surprising features: they are excellent swimmers, they have excellent hearing, and in emergency situations they can jump up to 1.5 m.;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22678108/131902050
