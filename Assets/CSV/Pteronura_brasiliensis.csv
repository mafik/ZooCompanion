Pteronura brasiliensis; Giant Otter; Giant Otters are very voracious predators. They eat 3 to 5 kg of fish daily. They live in family groups consisting of a parent pair and subsequent litters. Older siblings help in caring for the younger one. As they forage, their ears close against their nostrils when they dive to find food. They use large eyes and long whiskers for orientation under water.; EN;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/18711/164580466
