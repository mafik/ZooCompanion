Choloepus didactylus;Two-toed Sloth;Sloths, like ruminants, have a divided stomach into several chambers. It is an adaptation to the intake of cellulose-rich food. They mainly eat leaves, shoots and fruit. Their hook-shaped claws make it easier for them to navigate through the trees. Although they move very clumsily on land, they are great swimmers.;LC;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/4777/47439542
