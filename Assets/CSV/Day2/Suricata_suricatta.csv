Suricata suricatta;Meerkat;Adult meerkats teach their young to hunt poisonous animals such as snakes and scorpions. Meerkats lead a daily lifestyle in herds that occupy a certain territory. During foraging, at least one of the herd members is positioned at the highest point of the terrain and observes the surroundings. In the event of danger, the guard makes an alarm sound appropriate to the threat, to which the herd reacts appropriately to the situation.;LC;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41624/45209377
