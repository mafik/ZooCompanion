Lama guanicoe;Guanaco;Guanacos are extremely hardy animals capable of surviving in the harsh climate of the Andes and Patagonia. Interestingly, they swim well. Not to cunfuse iwth llamas: The llama is a domesticated form of the guanaco - but the llamas and their ancestors are so far apart that they are considered to be 2 separate species. The diet of these animals is primarily grasses and herbs. They only take water from food.;LC;https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11186/18540211
